title: For my boyfriend
---

Lord Jesus, bless and preserve my cherished boyfriend, whom you have given to me; let his life be long and blessed, comfortable and holy, successful and free.

Let me ever be a blessing and comfort to him, a sharer in all his sorrows, a consolation in all accidents and trials of life; make me forever lovable in his eyes and forever dear to him; unite his heart to mine in fondest love and holiness, and mine to him in all sweetness, charity and submission.

Keep me from all ungentleness; make me humble and obedient, that we may delight in each other according to your blessed Word.

May both of us rejoice in you, having our portion in the love and service of God. Forever.

Amen.
