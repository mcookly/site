title: For my girlfriend
---

Lord Jesus, bless and preserve my cherished wife, whom you have given to me; let her life be long and blessed, comfortable and holy, successful and free.

Help me to be the boyfriend that you want me to be for her.

Let me ever be a blessing and comfort for her, a sharer in all her sorrows, a strength in her moments of helplessness, a consolation in all accidents and trials of life.

Keep me from all ungentleness, infidelity, ill-temper and hasty judgement.

Guard me from words or actions that may hurt, ignore or take her for granted.

Let me treat her with honor and respect, tenderness and compassion, that we may delight in each other according to your blessed Word.

I place her in your care, Lord, knowing that your love for her is greater than my own.

Keep us close to each other in this life and guide us to our true and heavenly home.

Amen.
