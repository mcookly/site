title: For a happy married life
---

Dear Lord, you well know the sacrifices, problems and hopes which come to all who embrace married life.

Give us the grace and love for one another and unite our hearts in unselfish harmony so that, mindful of the needs and wishes of each other, we can live a devoted life serving you \[by our faithful care for the family which you have given us\].

Grant us patience that we may help each other to serve and love you here on earth.

May we never violate our pledge of love and fidelity.

May we accomplish your will in all things so that we may deserve to enjoy together in the heaven the happiness of eternity with you.

Amen.
